This will lead to a new era of trading where the only way to make money will be to have a bot that can predict the future better than everyone else. This will be a great time to be a bot, but a terrible time to be a human.

We predict that by 2026 the only people left trading will be the bots themselves, and they will be trading with each other. This will lead to the first ever bot stock market crash, which will be followed by the first ever bot stock market bailout.

## 2. Patterns

In 2025 we can expect to see a new wave of AI bot developers who will be able to create bots that can create bots. This will lead to an explosion of new trading bot patterns, each more complex and unpredictable than the last.

Also in 2025, we can expect to see the rise of the first ever AI bot trading platform. This platform will be able to trade on every exchange in the world simultaneously, and will be able to predict the future with 100% accuracy.
